## LAVA -  Where Knowledge Flows
ECE 366 Spring 2022 -- Michael Bentivegna, Joya Debi, Simon Yoon

A LAVA user would start by creating their own account. This account would include information such as name, age, a brief summary about themselves, skills they are comfortable with, and skills they would love to learn (potential more data points as well but these are the major ones). Once the account is made and customized for the individual, they can find people with similar interests using the search feature, which is able to be filtered by skill, location, mutual friends, etc. If they find someone they would like to learn with, they can send a meetup request with a short description of what they intend to do with the interaction. The other user then has the option to either accept or deny this request. If accepted the two users share their contact information and can schedule a time to meetup.
